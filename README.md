# Inventory-Dashboard
Inventory management is critical to achieving a balance between product availability and minimizing holding costs. Businesses often struggle with managing stock levels for high-demand products while also needing to reduce overstocking for lower-performing items. This dashboard addresses the need for a clear, visual representation of revenue trends, product performance, and inventory data, allowing stakeholders to quickly identify high-demand products, assess seasonal sales trends, and adjust inventory to prevent stockouts or excess. This dashboard provides a centralized view of revenue and inventory data, empowering business leaders to make informed decisions on product stocking, sales strategies, and pricing. It also helps to prevent stockouts of popular items and minimize costs associated with overstocking. Ultimately, this leads to improved customer satisfaction, better inventory turnover, and optimized revenue.
